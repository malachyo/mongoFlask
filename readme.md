# Build a Community Board with Flask and MongoDB (with a little help from PyMongo)

Clone this repository to get started building a Flask app with a MongoDB database.

This app allows users to input events onto a page for future reference or reminders.
The homepage displays all stored events, their date, and the kind of event it is.
Three input fields are given to the user on the inputs page.

The data values are stored in a MongoDB database.
